# Kernel_PCA

In this Notebook, I'm covering the topic:

Dimensionality Reduction

using: sklearn.decomposition KernelPCA

KernelPCA is an unsupervised decomposition algorithm.

Case-study:
A wine recommender system

A wine merchant has collected a dataset on different brands and kinds of wine using many different bottles of wine, which he has already sold to his customers. This dataset contains many features of wine as input.

The clustering task has already been made on customers, who bought these bottles. As a result, the customers are classified into 3 categories: 1, 2 and 3.

The customers-categories field is the output.

The number of features is somehow high, and we want to make a dimensionality reduction if possible to end up with a smaller umber of features.

Then, we would like to build a reduced-dimensionality model that will be able to predict the potential customers for the new wine bottles, so they are to be recommended to them.
